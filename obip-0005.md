## Abstract

This OBIP describes the design of a 'classified'. Classifieds enabled a user can create a type of listing that can be used as a non-purchasable ad, where settlment of the listing takes place outside of OpenBazaar's internal wallet.  

## Motivation

OpenBazaar currently assumes all settlement will take place using Bitcoin via its internal wallet. However, many users may wish to take advantage of OpenBazaar's growing user-base, hosting & listing infrastructure to advertise their goods and services, but settle the transaction with buyers outside of Bitcoin.

## Requirements

Classifieds enable the user to create a new listing type in addition to physical goods, digital goods, and services. This listing type cannot be purchased within OpenBazaar, but allows for all of listing functionality.

## Specification

The specification calls for a change to `contracts.pb`, where a new `ContractType` is enumerated: `CLASSIFIED`.

```
enum ContractType {
    PHYSICAL_GOOD = 0;
    DIGITAL_GOOD  = 1;
    SERVICE       = 2;
    CROWD_FUND    = 3;
    CLASSIFIED    = 4;
}
```

All nodes must reject purchases of a 'classified' listing type.

## Rationale

*Advantages*

1. Extends the functionality of OpenBazaar
2. Allows vendors who are not into Bitcoin to list on a decentralised marketplace, and can serve as a gateway to draw these people into cryptocurrency

*Disadvantages*

1. Search indexes will need to filter-out classifieds from physical, digital, and service listing types
2. Dedicated interface required for viewing classifieds that needs careful thought to avoid confusion for users

## Backwards Compatibility

1. Non-upgraded nodes will not be able to create a classified. Since classifieds cannot be purchased by design, no major compatibility issues for purchasing should exist.
2. Clients typically display a store tab or view, where all of the user's listings are visible. Classifieds would need to be excluded from this list to prevent confusion, and a scenario where a user would attempt to purchase a classified. As a result, a store tab/view should only show listing types: `PHYSICAL_GOODS`, `DIGITAL_GOODS`, or `SERVICES`. Incidentally this is something that would need to happen necessarily as the protocol expands to support other listings types. Filtering out the `CLASSIFIED` listing type is similar to filtering out listings that do not ship to your country.
3. Search engines would need to factor-in what listing types are indexed, and what listing types are served by their endpoints. Search engines may elect to provide an endpoint dedicated to search for only classifieds.
